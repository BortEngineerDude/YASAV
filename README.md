Yet Another Sorting Algorithm Visualiser 

Inspired by this guy and his work:
https://github.com/bingmann/sound-of-sorting

This is the reimplementation of his work from scratch using Qt with emphasis on more detailed visualisuation(minus sound). I'm doing this for self-entertaiment and to explore Qt and C++.
